There have been several signatures of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) seen in the
TeV proton+proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, some
of those include long-range ridge-like correlations, strangeness enhancement, com-
parable freeze-out temperature with a deconfinement transition temperature, etc.
Although so far it is inconclusive to conclude on the formation of QGP in TeV
hadronic collisions, it is compelling to make deeper studies to understand the matter
created in the high-multiplicity hadronic collisions. I shall discuss the experimental
findings, confronted with theoretical studies to understand a possible QGP-droplet
formation in TeV proton+proton collisions, while giving a background of the search
for QGP in heavy-ion collisions.
