The strong interaction, as described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), shows
a rich phase structure at finite temperature and density. At low temperatures and
densities, the relevant degrees of freedom are color-singlet bound states of hadrons.
At very high temperatures and densities these hadrons break up to liberate quarks
and gluons and form the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Such a state of matter has
existed in the early universe. One expects to find such a state near the core of a
compact star. In the laboratory, strongly interacting matter at high temperature
and density is produced by ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions. In this lecture
I will discuss the thermodynamic aspects of this phase transition : from hadrons to
quarks.
